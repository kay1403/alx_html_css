It demonstrates your understanding of:

* CSS basics
* Box model
* Selectors
* Specificity
* Flexbox layout
* Responsive design
* Viewport configuration
* Proper HTML structure and styling
* W3C-compliant code

## **Project Requirements**

* All files must end with a new line.
* No external libraries or frameworks (React, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Vue, Tailwind).
* Only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** allowed.
* Code must be **W3C valid** (HTML & CSS validated using W3C validators).
* `base.css` must be included exactly at the top of all pages.
* Flexbox must be used for page layout.
* Responsive behavior must be implemented using the ALX-provided class:

  ```
  class="works_on_smartphone"
  ```
* A proper viewport meta tag must be included in `index.html`.

## **What I implemented**

### **0. Initial Styling**

* Added `base.css` and `styles.css`
* Linked both stylesheets inside `<head>` of each HTML file.

### **1. Flexbox Positioning**

* `body` uses flex-direction: column
* `main` uses flex-direction: row
* `article` takes 2/3 of width
* `aside` takes 1/3
* Scroll enabled with `overflow-y: auto`

### **2. Responsive Design**

* Added `class="works_on_smartphone"` on `<body>`
* Added the viewport meta tag
* Layout stacks on small screens

### **3. Additional Styling**

* Custom colors, borders, scrollbars, and spacing
* Optional logo in `<header>`
* Personalized article content styling
